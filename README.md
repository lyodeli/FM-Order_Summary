## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project felt really good to finish. It was one I had started about a month ago, set aside after several days of frustration, and then picked back up again. It only took me a few hours to complete from scratch this time around. I'm actually learning, and it felt really dang good to be able to put this together so quickly and feel flexbox coming together in my brain.

But I recognize I'm still new, so any feedback/thoughts are always welcome!
